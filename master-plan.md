# Master Plan: Hybrid SQLite Approach for La mathil Quiz Fizz

## Overview
This master plan outlines the consolidated approach to develop, test, and deploy the La mathil Quiz Fizz application using a hybrid SQLite database approach. This plan replaces all previous documentation and focuses on a streamlined development process.

## Current Status
- [x] SQLite database implementation in progress
- [x] Dependencies installed
- [ ] Code updates and modifications required
- [ ] Mobile app development for hybrid approach
- [ ] Launch development server and identify required changes

## Phase 1: Database Implementation

### 1.1 Current SQLite Setup
The application is currently using SQLite with the `better-sqlite3` library:
- Database file: `quiz_fizz.db` (in project root)
- Connection handled through `src/lib/database.js`
- Schema defined in `scripts/setup-database.js`
- Tables created for game sessions, players, events, trivia questions, and player answers

### 1.2 Database Features
- Foreign key constraints enabled
- WAL (Write-Ahead Logging) mode for better performance
- JSON storage for complex data structures
- Indexes for improved query performance

## Phase 2: Code Updates and Modifications

### 2.1 API Route Updates
All API routes have been updated to use the SQLite database:
- `/api/get-game-state` - Retrieves current game state
- `/api/join-game` - Handles player joining
- `/api/draw-ball` - Manages ball drawing
- `/api/update-player-card` - Updates player bingo cards
- `/api/host-controls` - Handles host actions

### 2.2 Database Helper
The `src/lib/database.js` file provides:
- SQLite query helper that mimics PostgreSQL template literal syntax
- Transaction support
- Connection management

### 2.3 Setup Scripts
- `npm run db:setup` - Creates database schema and inserts sample data
- `npm run db:test` - Tests database connectivity

## Phase 3: Hybrid Mobile App Development

### 3.1 Mobile App Structure
- Directory: `mobile/` (currently empty)
- Will implement mobile-specific features
- Will share core game logic with web version

### 3.2 Hybrid Approach Benefits
- Single codebase for game logic
- Platform-specific UI/UX optimizations
- Offline capabilities using SQLite
- Real-time sync when online

## Phase 4: Development Server Launch

### 4.1 Pre-launch Checklist
- [ ] Verify all database tables created correctly
- [ ] Test all API endpoints
- [ ] Confirm sample data inserted
- [ ] Validate database connection pooling
- [ ] Check error handling

### 4.2 Launch Process
1. Run `npm run db:setup` to initialize database
2. Start development server with `npm run dev`
3. Access application at http://localhost:3000
4. Monitor console for any errors
5. Test all game functionalities

### 4.3 Post-launch Evaluation
- Identify any required changes based on testing
- Optimize database queries if needed
- Add indexes for frequently accessed data
- Implement caching strategies

## Phase 5: Future Enhancements

### 5.1 Mobile App Features
- Native mobile UI components
- Push notifications for game events
- Camera integration for QR code scanning
- Biometric authentication

### 5.2 Database Improvements
- Query optimization
- Additional indexes
- Data archiving for old games
- Backup and recovery procedures

### 5.3 Game Features
- Additional game modes
- Tournament system
- Player statistics
- Social sharing

## Technical Architecture

### Database Schema
The current schema includes:
- `game_sessions` - Manages game sessions with status, mode, and game state
- `players` - Manages player information and bingo card data
- `game_events` - Tracks all events that occur during gameplay
- `trivia_questions` - Stores trivia questions for quiz games
- `player_answers` - Stores player responses to trivia questions

### Key Relationships
- `game_sessions` is the central table that connects to all other tables
- `players` are associated with `game_sessions` through `session_id`
- `trivia_questions` are associated with `game_sessions` through `session_id`
- `player_answers` connects `players` to `trivia_questions`
- `game_events` tracks all activities within a `game_session`

## Development Workflow

### 1. Environment Setup
```bash
npm install
npm run db:setup
```

### 2. Development
```bash
npm run dev
```

### 3. Testing
```bash
npm run db:test
```

## Success Criteria

### Database Functionality
- [ ] All tables created with correct schema
- [ ] Foreign key relationships working
- [ ] Sample data inserted correctly
- [ ] Queries execute without errors

### API Functionality
- [ ] All endpoints respond correctly
- [ ] Data is stored and retrieved accurately
- [ ] Error handling works properly
- [ ] Performance is acceptable

### Application Functionality
- [ ] Game can be created and joined
- [ ] Bingo cards are generated correctly
- [ ] Balls can be drawn
- [ ] Wins are detected
- [ ] Trivia questions work
- [ ] Player answers are recorded

## Risk Mitigation

### Technical Risks
1. **Database Performance**: Monitor query performance and add indexes as needed
2. **Data Consistency**: Use transactions for multi-table operations
3. **Concurrency**: Test with multiple simultaneous users

### Development Risks
1. **Scope Creep**: Stick to the defined features and requirements
2. **Testing Gaps**: Ensure comprehensive testing of all functionality
3. **Integration Issues**: Test database and API integration thoroughly

## Communication Plan

### Daily Check-ins
- Review progress on current task
- Address any blockers
- Plan next steps

### Weekly Reviews
- Assess overall progress
- Adjust timeline if needed
- Review completed work

## Tools and Resources

### Development Tools
- Visual Studio Code
- Node.js and npm
- SQLite database browser (for debugging)
- Git for version control

### Documentation
- Next.js documentation
- SQLite documentation
- React documentation

## Conclusion

This master plan provides a clear path forward for the La mathil Quiz Fizz project using a hybrid SQLite approach. By following this structured approach, we'll be able to:

1. Successfully implement and test the SQLite database
2. Update and modify the code as needed
3. Develop the mobile app using a hybrid approach
4. Launch the development server and identify required changes
5. Continue enhancing the application with new features

The plan focuses on a streamlined development process that consolidates all previous documentation into a single, cohesive approach.
